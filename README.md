# Abstract

We present a personalized and reliable prediction model for healthcare, which can provide individually tailored medical services such as diagnosis, disease treatment, and prevention. Our proposed framework targets at making personalized and reliable predictions from time-series data, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), by modeling two complementary components: i) a shared component that captures global trend across diverse patients and ii) a patient-specific component that models idiosyncratic variability for each patient. To this end, we propose a composite model of a deep  neural network to learn complex global trends from the large number of patients, and Gaussian Processes (GP) to probabilistically model individual time-series given relatively small number of visits per patient. We evaluate our model on diverse and heterogeneous tasks from EHR datasets and show practical advantages over standard time-series deep models such as pure Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
